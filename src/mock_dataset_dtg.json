        "description": "Data were collected during the Multi-Modal Intelligent Transportation Signal Systems (MMITSS) study. MMITSS is a next-generation traffic signal system that seeks to provide a comprehensive traffic information framework to service all modes of transportation.The Signal Plans for Roadside Equipment (RSE) data contains the basics of a Signal Phase and Timing (SPAT) message. This data includes SPAT message and the timestamp of the SPAT message. The data also provides the signal phase and timing information for one or more movements at an intersection.",
